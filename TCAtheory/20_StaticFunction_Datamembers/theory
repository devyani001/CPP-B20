calling default constructor and parameterized constrauctor at the same time
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

class A
{
	int i;

	public :
	A(int i = 0)
	{
		this->i = i;
	}

};

int main()
{
	A.ob();	 // by default it will call default constructor
	A.ob(5); // by default it will call parameterized constructor
}


doubt
------
Q. Why class chya end madhe semicolon(;) deto in cpp, java madhe nhi det


function calling
-----------------
--> Normal function - called using object name (Non-static function)
	ex: ob.display();
--> Static function - called using class  name
	ex: A::show();


STATIC CONCEPT
===============
--> Class can have static or non-static members both.
--> Class can have static Data member as well as static function.
--> Static Members are accessed using class name
	Ex:
				A::display();
--> 
--> If class have static data member like "static int s;" then this member must be initialized outside the class. Therefore 's' variable will have global scope.
--> static variable gets memory when program is loaded ( main() chya adhi yala memory milte ) and non-static variable gets memory when object is created
	DOUBT : 
	--------
	mg static member class chya adhi delare ka nhi krt
	--> tevha tyala mahit nste class declare zala nhi mhnun. ata 2min nantr ky honar ahe he apn sangu skto ka nhi like that
--> In static function you can access only static data member.
	But in non-static function you can access non-static data member as well as static data member.
--> Use : Sharability
	Static data member are shared by object.




CLASS
======
--> Class is a collection of data member and member function. where data members and member functions can be static as well as non-static data members.
