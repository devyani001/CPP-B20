							STATIC AND DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION
 						  ========================================

--> Integer Memory la point krnar 'Integer Pointer'.
--> Float Memory la point krnar 'Float Pointer'.
--> Object Memory la point krnar 'Object Pointer'.
--> 'this' is a 'Object Pointer'.

MEMORY ALLOCATION
==================

There are two types of Memory Allocation
	1. Static Memory Allocation  / Compile time Memory Allocation
	2. Dynamic Memory Allocation / Runtime Memory Allocation


Static Memory Allocation  / Compile time Memory Allocation
-----------------------------------------------------------
--> When memory is allocated to the program during compile time by the compiler such type of memory allocation is called as Static Memory Allocation.
--> This type of Memory Allocation is Fixed/Permanent
	i.e., it never shrinks or grow during runtime.

--> Ex :
		int i;					// 4  byte
		int a[3];				// 12 byte

		Student ob;				// 28 byte (rno : 4, name : 20, per : 4)
		Student S[3];			// 28*3 byte



Dynamic Memory Allocation / Runtime Memory Allocation
------------------------------------------------------
--> When memory is allocated to the program during its runtime (Execution time) such type of memory allocation is called as Dynamic Memory Allocation.
--> Dynamically Allocated Memory will given on 'HEAP'.




YOU MUST KNOW :
================
--> ( funtion madhe declare kelele variable la memory kuthe milte 'STACK' vr
	 ani je dynamically memory allocate krte tyala memory 'HEAP' vr milte )
--> in java everything is dynamic.
--> ( MEMORY ALLOCATION IN C & CPP )
				C 				C++
				----			-----
				(Functions)		(Operators)
allocate   -	malloc()		new
deallocate -	free			delete
				
'new' 	 - is an operator used to allocate memory on HEAP
'delete' - is an operator used to free dynamically allocated Memory.
		   delete i;
		   // not possible coz i is statically defined. and delete is used to dealloate memory in c++ dynamically.
		   if u want to deallocate memory u must have to use 'Pointer' concept. i.e., Object Pointer.
