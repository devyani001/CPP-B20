									FRIEND FUNCTION & FRIEND CLASS
								   ================================

Java does not have this concept only CPP has


FRIEND FUNCTION & FRIEND CLASS
-------------------------------
--> Reflexive relationship is not possible in friend class declaration. Means if class A is friend of class B then it does not mean class B is friend of class A.
--> Transitive relationship is not possible in friend class declaration.
--> Friendship can be declared anywhere in the class i.e., in an any section (public/private/protected). 
--> Friend Functions is a reason, why C++ is not called as a pure Object-Oriented language. Because it violates the concept of Encapsulation.



Friend Fucntions

Friend Class

	{
		cout << "In show I : " << tob.i << endl;
		// tob.display();
	}



--> class B class A che private data member access kru skto but wise-versa is not possible.
