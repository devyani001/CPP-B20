										Object Pointer
 								    ======================

Q. What is Pointer ?
---------------------
ek memory ahe jyat apn address thu skto
--> Pointer is a Memory which stores address.

	int i  = 77;
	int *p = &i;	--> Referencing Statement

	* --> Pointer
	& --> AddressOf Operator

	int p  = &j;
	prt p chi value change zali for i to j. that's why it is called as 'Pointer Variable'.
	ji gosht change hote called as 'Variable'.

	cout << i;		// 77
	cout << *p;		// 77		--> dereferencing Statement

	*P = 88;

	cout << i << endl;		// 88
	cout << *P << endl;		// 88
	changed the data of i using pointer P;


--> 'P' is a pointer variable.
--> 'P' is a integer pointer means it should point to integer variable.



Q. What is Object Pointer ?
----------------------------
--> Pointer of type class is called as 'Object Pointer'
	class Student
	{
		--
		--
	}

	Student *P;	--> Here P is Object pointer bcz its type is 'Student' and 'Student' is a class.
			--> Student and P ekadh class cha asla pahije

--> Object pointer points to Object means it stores address of same class object.
															--------

Here 'P' is a object pointer points to object of type 'Student'
ob.rno			--> Error bcz rno is private
ob.display()	--> Allowed
p ->(pointer points to rno) rno		--> Error bcz rno is private
p -> display(); --> Allowed
